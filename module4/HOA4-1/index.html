                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, where I have developed
                    strong foundations in programming, algorithms, data structures, and system design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.
                    I enjoy working on projects such as chatbots, image processing systems, and AI-powered applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am constantly learning new technologies and looking for opportunities to grow as a developer
